# ledc
Really ugly opcode to control LED-Shows in constrained environments.

LEGO has built an incredible [ferris wheel](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Ferris-Wheel-10247),
but it is even more awesome when you add some more visual effects to it.

The project that powers this repository features the following components:

 - LEGO ferris wheel
 - 12V DC Current
 - 12V to 5V 6A Step-Down Voltage regulator
 - A really huge electronic capacitor
 - A Conrad [C-Control IoT WiFi Board](https://www.conrad.de/de/evaluationsboard-c-control-open-iot-wifi-board-arduino-nano-compatibel-1387029.html) (comparable with an Arduino Nano, but with an ESP8266 added)
 - 12x Pimoroni [Mote APA102 RGB LED-Strip](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/mote)

As the Arduino Nano is very limited with space there was a need to stick
LED-Shows into a format that consumes less memory - so `ledc` was born.

`ledc` introduces something assembler-like to execute certain
"draw"-operations on LED-Strips. Each instruction is stuffed into a
32-bit word while there are 15 instructions (4 bit of instruction, 28
bit parameters).

There is one special "meta-instruction" `SETCOLOR` that actually has a
3-bit instruction and 29 bit for parameters. This is very ugly but
needed if you want to use the whole set of features of an APA102-LED.
At some places in code this is referenced as `SETCOLOR`, some other
places use `SETCOLOR0` and `SETCOLOR1` for this.

The virtual-machine here is capabale of driving 16 LED-Strips and has
up to 16 registers to store things in background. You may also define
up to 16 groups of LED-Strips and registers that could be controlled
using normal instructions as you would control a single LED-Strip or
register.

| COPY        | Source, Destination, Start, Length, Offset | Copy set of pixels from source to destination, shifting by offset |
| MIRRORS     | Source, Destination, Length                | Mirror an entire strip to a set of other strips                   |
| SHIFTR      | Start, Length                              | Shift all of LED-Strips contents to the right                     |
| GROUPADDS   | Group, Start, Length                       | Append a series of LED-Strips or registers to a group             |
| GROUPADDI   | Group, Index1 ... Index3                   | Append given LED-Strips or registers to a group                   |
| FRAME       | Wait                                       | Display the changes on the LED-Strips and Wait                    |
| GOTO        | Label                                      | Jump to a given label and continue execution from there on        |

See `shows/` for example programms as Assembler-Code and in compiled format.

## Compiler
There is a small compiler written in PHP located in `compiler/`. It's a
CLI-Script that is invoked in the way

~~~ {.bash}
php led-compile.php {path-to-led-programm}
~~~

It produces an `.ledc`-file that is suitable for upload to the
Arduino-Interpreter.

## Emulator
There is an Emulator to run `ledc`-programms via Javascript in HTML located in `emulator/`.

## Interpreter
The actual programm that executes `ledc`-code and creates the magic may be
found in `interpreter/`. It's a small arduino-project that implements the
interpreter and drives the APA102-LED-Strips using Software-SPI.

All LED-Strips are controlled in parallel - you'll need (Number of Strips + 1)
GPIO-Pins to drive the LED-Strips, one GPIO per Strip for Data and one GPIO
as clock connected to all Strips.

The programm expected all GPIO-Pins to be populated in ascending order, e.g.
first strip at GPIO 3, second strip at GPIO 4, etc.. But you may group
strips into up to four banks of LED-Strip-Connectors. You'll find some
`#define`'s for this on the code.
